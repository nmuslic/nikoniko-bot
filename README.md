# nikoniko-bot
Slack bot for daily well-being check in within a channel

Niko-Niko allows each team member to record a graphic evaluation of their mood during that day. Over time, the Niko-Niko calendar reveals patterns of change in the moods of the team, or of individual members.

The value of this practice lies in making somewhat objective an important element of team performance – motivation or well-being – which is generally seen as entirely subjective and thus impossible to measure and track.


Niko-Niko will send a daily message each weekday to your channel asking you to state your current mood of the day using one of the 3 emojis. It will save the mood for each user the following day just before the daily message for the next day is sent. Each user has 1 workday to state their mood.
